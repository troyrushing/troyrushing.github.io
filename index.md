# **Welcome to My Project Presentation!**

My name is Troy Rushing. I have been working on my bachelor's degree in computer science at Southern New Hampshire University
for over 2 years and I am nearly complete! The intent of this page is to present some of the capabilities I've developed included 
in my senior projects. These project demonstrates my capabilities in Software Design, Software Development, Database
Management, and implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms. 

This page includes code and projects to better display my skills and capabilities. 

## Self Assessment
When I started the Computer Science (CS) program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), I had little knowledge or exposure to the various aspects of the computer science field. Throughout my course of studies, I have learned and honed my skills in a variety of aspects of computer science. I have learned a myriad of computer science disciplines from computer hardware, operating systems, multiple computer programming languages, software team collaboration, data structures and algorithms, software design & engineering, database creation and manipulation, and security.

Through CS-310-Collaboration and Team Project, we learned the valuable skill of working on a collaborative software team. In this course, we, as a class, worked collaboratively on a digital jukebox project in which everyone in the class uploaded their own playlist into the jukebox application. First, we learned how to use industry standard tools such as github repositories to store and merge code. Additionally in this course, we learned how to perform effective, constructive code reviews. 

Through CS-250-Software Development Lifecycle, and IT-328-Project Management in Info Tech, we learned the necessity of effective project management in a software project. One of the primary ideas we learned through these two courses is the value of proper stakeholder communication. This includes managing stakeholder expectations. Keeping stakeholders informed and comfortable with the progress of a project is essential to the project success.

IT-140-Introduction to Scripting, IT-145-foundation in Application Development, CS-260-Data Structures & Algorithms, and CS-340-Client/Server Development introduced us to advanced concepts in programming and honed our skills in programming. Throughout these courses, we also learned techniques in software engineering & design as well as how to construct effective algorithms and employ various data structures. Through the enhancement of my Car Rental application in this ePorfolio, I have demonstrated my skills and capabilities in these areas. I did this by taking a conceptually sound idea of a program and enhancing it into a polished program that can handle a variety of scenarios and inputs, efficiently and effectively while implementing proper failure handling.

Through the CS program we also learned how to create, read, manipulate and run queries on multiple database types. We learned MySQL in DAD-220-Introduction to SQL, and we learned No-SQL MongoDB in CS-340- Client/Server Development. I have developed skills and capabilities in creating databases, creating tables, updating data, deleting data, and using queries to display only desired data. This is demonstrated in my database enhancement in this ePortfolio.

Network security and program security were an undertone in all of the CS program classes at SNHU. In todayâ€™s environment, security needs to be a primary focus in any IT related project or program. Security is possibly the most important issue in the computer science industry today. There are limitless numbers of hackers out there trying to steal everything from your personal identity to national security secrets. Hackers are out there day and night looking for weaknesses that they can exploit for their benefit whether intentions be as simple as accessing your credit card information or committing cyberterrorism.

Through the enhancement of my Car Rental application in this ePorfolio, I have demonstrated my skills and capabilities in software engineering & design as well as algorithms & data structures. I did this by taking a conceptually sound idea of a program and enhancing it into a polished program that can handle a variety of scenarios and inputs efficiently and effectively. Additionally, this program now employs advanced algorithms for additional cost calculating and incorporates data structures.

I have demonstrated my skills and capabilities in databases through the creation/enhancement of a MySQL database in this ePortfolio. This enhancement demonstrates a real world scenario of creating a necessary database for a business. Further, it demonstrates the ability to execute database function such as populating tables, updating data, deleting data, and using queries to display only desired data. These are necessary skills for someone entering into a new career that would involve database work or database management

## Projects
- Rental Car Program and Database Design Code Review
  - The code review file exceeded the file size allowed by GitHub so I broke the code review into two parts. Part 1 focuses on the Software Engineering & Design enhancement. Part 2 focuses on the Algorithms & Data Structures enhancement as well as the Database enhancement.
